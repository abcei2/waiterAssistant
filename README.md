# [Waiter assistant](https://waiter-assistant.vercel.app)
This demo aims to:
1. Collect table orders based on who ordered so him can bring them the check for
their products afterwards.
2. Generate the check for each of the members of a table based on what they
ordered.
3. Include the approved tip for each table member in their checks, and collect it easily

### Desktop installation.

Trying to follow this guide: [react-native-windows](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/getting-started), and so others,
but without success because of many problems on RNVG project packages used by react-native-svg. 

### TODO
